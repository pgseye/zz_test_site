    "section": "2 The Answer",
    "text": "2 The Answer\n\nThe answer is B. Younger male drivers tend to be more stupid and injure themselves more seriously than their female counterparts. Upon reaching a suitable age of maturity their risk of hospitalisation reduces to about the same (if we assume the 95% CI for the 8% reduction includes 0) as that for females.\nWhen a third variable plays a role in the association between an exposure and an outcome it may act as a confounder OR effect modifier (AND sometimes both).\nA simple confounder (e.g. age) will show the same exposure -&gt; outcome association across all of its categories (e.g. same risk ratio in &lt; 40 yrs and ≥ 40 yrs)\nAn effect modifier will show different magnitudes of association across its categories (e.g. the risk ratio will differ in those &lt; 40 yrs and ≥ 40 yrs).\nStratification is the simplest form of exploring and adjusting for confounding/interaction effects (used before we had all this computing power).\nSubgroups of data are created for each category of confounder/effect modifier and estimates of interest (mean differences, risk ratios, etc) calculated in each.\nThese can then be combined in a weighted manner to give an overall (adjusted) estimate if NO effect modification is present.\nThis is equivalent to including the third variable as a covariate in our regression model (we now use models rather than stratification methods).\nSimple inclusion in the regression model (using + in R) FORCES the exposure -&gt; outcome association to be the same across all categories of the effect modifier even if in reality it’s not.\n+ assumes confounding ONLY and NO effect modification.\nA problem arises, however, when the third variable is more an effect modifier, rather than confounder.\nIf we suspect effect modification is present, we need to include this third variable in the model as an interaction term (using * in R)\nThis will allow the exposure -&gt; outcome association to differ across categories of the effect modifier.\n* assumes effect modification is present.\nThis is a more flexible model specification, than simply ‘adjusting’ for a variable.\nInterpretation is a little more involved (always happy to help with this) but the point is it’s important not to blindly assume a third variable can only ever be a confounder.\nIf effect modification is present, you need to know about it.\nIt is simple to test for effect modification in R, Stata, etc. Include the interaction term and then drop it if not clinically/statistically significant at some level.\nI have included some R output below showing the equivalence of stratification and modelling approaches to interaction effects.\n\nBefore we get to that - a simple set of guidelines for how to think about crude vs stratified associations:\n\nEquivalence of model-derived crude estimate\nRecall that the aggregated data that the crude estimate is calculated from is:\n\n\nCode\ndat_agg &lt;- data.frame(sex = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"),\n                      hospitalised = as.numeric(c(1330, 798)), \n                      not_hospitalised = as.numeric(c(7018,6400)))\ndat_agg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsex\nhospitalised\nnot_hospitalised\n\n\n\n\nMale\n1330\n7018\n\n\nFemale\n798\n6400\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo estimate this model in R we essentially run a logistic regression but instead of outputting an odds ratio, we calculate a risk ratio by specifying a log rather than the default logit link. We will also use the aggregate model specification, as we don’t have the individual-level data.\nThe model-derived crude risk ratio for sex = 1.44 (95% CI 1.32, 1.56; p &lt; 0.001). This is very close to the estimate that we initially calculated manually from the 2 x 2 table (1.45).\n\n\nCode\nmod_crude &lt;- glm(cbind(hospitalised, not_hospitalised) ~ sex, data = dat_agg, family = binomial(link = \"log\"))\ntbl_regression(mod_crude, exp = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      RR1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    sex\n\n\n\n        Female\n—\n—\n\n        Male\n1.44\n1.32, 1.56\n&lt;0.001\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 RR = Relative Risk, CI = Confidence Interval"

The model formulation in R is then:\nmod_adj &lt;- glm(cbind(hospitalised, not_hospitalised) ~ sex + age, data = dat_agg, family = binomial(link = \"log\"))\nand the risk ratios we get are:\n\n\nCode\nmod_confound &lt;- glm(cbind(hospitalised, not_hospitalised) ~ sex + age, data = dat_disagg, family = binomial(link = \"log\"))\ntbl_regression(mod_confound, exp = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      RR1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    sex\n\n\n\n        Female\n—\n—\n\n        Male\n1.43\n1.32, 1.55\n&lt;0.001\n    age\n\n\n\n        &lt; 40\n—\n—\n\n        ≥ 40\n0.47\n0.43, 0.51\n&lt;0.001\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 RR = Relative Risk, CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nSo, what we are seeing here is that the magnitude of association between sex and hospitalisation risk is averaged (in a weighted way) over both categories of age to produce one effect estimate sex = 1.43 (95% CI 1.32, 1.55; p &lt; 0.001). This just so happens to be almost the same as the crude estimate when you ignore age altogether.\nThe effect for age in this model is such that whatever your sex, there is about a 53% reduction in the risk of hospitalisation if you are over 40 vs under 40. Note that in the stratification approach, you aren’t able to calculate an effect for age because you are stratifying by it (essentially treating it as a nuisance variable).\n\n\n3.2 Age as an effect modifier\nNow, let’s correctly model age as an effect modifier in the association between sex and hospitalisation risk. The model formulation in R is then (note the * operator):\nmod_adj &lt;- glm(cbind(hospitalised, not_hospitalised) ~ sex * age, data = dat_agg, family = binomial(link = \"log\"))\nand the risk ratios we get are:\n\n\nCode\nmod_interact &lt;- glm(cbind(hospitalised, not_hospitalised) ~ sex * age, data = dat_disagg, family = binomial(link = \"log\"))\ntbl_regression(mod_interact, exp = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      RR1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    sex\n\n\n\n        Female\n—\n—\n\n        Male\n1.77\n1.60, 1.96\n&lt;0.001\n    age\n\n\n\n        &lt; 40\n—\n—\n\n        ≥ 40\n0.70\n0.61, 0.80\n&lt;0.001\n    sex * age\n\n\n\n        Male * ≥ 40\n0.52\n0.44, 0.62\n&lt;0.001\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 RR = Relative Risk, CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNote how the p value for the interaction term is very low - this would be a good indicator that the model fits the data better with the interaction term present than without it (i.e. assuming age as a confounder only).\nAs I mentioned earlier, the model interpretation with an interaction present does become a little more complicated, but let’s break this down (note that I use “effect” in a non-causal way):\n\nThe coefficient for sex = 1.77 (95% CI 1.60, 1.96; p &lt; 0.001). The represents the “effect” of sex (being male relative to female) on hospitalisation risk at the reference level of age, which in this case is the under 40 yrs group. So, for those under 40, there is about a 77% increased risk for males relative to females.\nThe coefficient for age = 0.70 (95% CI 0.61, 0.80; p &lt; 0.001). This represents the “effect” of age (being older than 40 yrs relative to younger than 40 yrs) on hospitalisation risk at the reference level of sex, which in this case is female. So, for females, there is about a 30% risk reduction in the need for hospitalisation for older relative to younger drivers.\nThe coefficient for the interaction term: sex * age = 0.52 (95% CI 0.44, 0.62; p &lt; 0.001). This represents the multiplicative increase in the magnitude of association for males over 40 yrs."

These are:\n\nThe effect of being male in younger individuals.\nThe effect of being male in older individuals.\nThe effect of being older in females.\nThe effect of being older in males.\n\nYou can easily enough work these out manually by multiplying the respective reference coefficients with the interaction coefficient.

You may not want to venture that far…\nWhat I think is cool about this problem is that while the result might seem counterintuitive to how we naturally process chance, using Bayesian reasoning provides a formulaic way to get at the right answer. This again uses conditional probabilities as I introduced them a few weeks ago. Bayesian thinking is about utilising prior knowledge in conjunction with new data to improve or update our knowledge (whereas the Frequentist approach to statistics doesn’t care so much about prior knowledge and instead just uses the data at hand).\nBayes Theorem can be written as:\n\\[\nPr(\\theta | data) = \\frac{Pr(data | \\theta) Pr(\\theta)}{Pr(data)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) could be a particular parameter or hypothesis.\nHere:\n\\(Pr(data | \\theta)\\) is the likelihood function (the evidence, or what we measure)\n\\(Pr(\\theta)\\) is the prior probability of our hypothesis (prior knowledge before we the measurement)\n\\(Pr(data)\\) is the prior probability of the data\n\\(Pr(\\theta | data)\\) is the posterior probability of our hypothesis (i.e. “in light of the data”)\nOn the Bayesian/Frequentist topic, note that \\(Pr(data | \\theta)\\) is what null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) encapsulates and this is a Frequentist concept. Whenever we calculate a p value we are asking:\n\n“What is the probability of this new data (or data even more extreme) occurring by chance given the null hypothesis is true?”\n\nBut really, what we want to know most of the time is the opposite:\n\n“What is the probability of the null hypothesis being true given this new data?”\n\nThat is a Bayesian concept and is answered with \\(Pr(\\theta | data)\\). Maybe we should become more Bayesian in how we handle our research…\nAnyway, excuse the digression. We can generalise Bayes Theorem to the Monty Hall problem as:\n\\[\nPr(\\text{car behind door x} | \\text{Monty opens door y}) = \\frac{Pr(\\text{Monty opens door y} | \\text{car behind door x}) Pr(\\text{car behind door x})}{Pr(\\text{Monty opens door y})}\n\\]\nFor the sake of the exercise, let x = door 1 and y = door 3.\nSo we are interested in the probability the car is behind door 1 (that means we picked door 1) when Monty opens door 3 to reveal a goat.\nIn calculating the different components of Bayes Theorem, we first need to enumerate the various probabilities.\n\\(Pr(\\text{car behind door 1}) = Pr(\\text{car behind door 2}) = Pr(\\text{car behind door 3}) = 33.3\\%\\)\nThese are the prior probabilities.\nThen:\n\\(Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3} | \\text{car behind door 1}) = 50\\%\\)\nMonty can only pick doors 2 or 3, as we picked door 1.\n\\(Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3} | \\text{car behind door 2}) = 100\\%\\)\nMonty can only pick door 3, as we picked door 1 and he doesn’t want to reveal the car behind door 2.\n\\(Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3} | \\text{car behind door 3}) = 0\\%\\)\nMonty won’t reveal the car as part of his playing rules.\nThese are the likelihoods or the evidence.\nThe \\(Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3})\\) is a little trickier to calculate. Here we don’t need to worry about the car being behind any specific door, only that Monty won’t reveal it. Intuitively, this would be \\(50\\%\\) as he only has two doors to choose from. But you can also work this out by summing the product of each of the prior probabilities and the evidence:\n\\(Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3}) = (0.33 * 0.5) + (0.33 * 1) + (0.33 * 0) = 0.5\\)\nFinally, we can get to working out the posterior probabilities of the car being behind each door given Monty opens door 3. We use Bayes Theorem as shown above to do this.\n\\[\nPr(\\text{car behind door 1} | \\text{Monty opens door 3}) = \\frac{Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3} | \\text{car behind door 1}) Pr(\\text{car behind door 1})}{Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3})}\n\\] \\[\n= \\frac{0.5 * 0.33}{0.5} = 33.3\\%\n\\] Likewise:\n\\[\nPr(\\text{car behind door 2} | \\text{Monty opens door 3})  = \\frac{1 * 0.33}{0.5} = 66.7\\%\n\\] and\n\\[\nPr(\\text{car behind door 3} | \\text{Monty opens door 3})  = \\frac{0 * 0.33}{0.5} = 0\\%\n\\]\nRemember, we initially chose door 1. So, when Monty opens door 3 (this could have been door 2 - we just needed to pick a door for the exercise), we double our chances of winning by switching to door 2. And this is how Bayesian reasoning can come to the rescue when our own intuition fails.\nFurther explanation can be found here if you remain unconvinced:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem\nhttps://statisticsbyjim.com/fun/monty-hall-problem/"
