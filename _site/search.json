    "section": "2 The Answer",
    "text": "2 The Answer\n\nThe answer is B. Younger male drivers tend to be more stupid and injure themselves more seriously than their female counterparts. Upon reaching a suitable age of maturity their risk of hospitalisation reduces to about the same (if we assume the 95% CI for the 8% reduction includes 0) as that for females.\nWhen a third variable plays a role in the association between an exposure and an outcome it may act as a confounder OR effect modifier (AND sometimes both).\nA simple confounder (e.g. age) will show the same exposure -&gt; outcome association across all of its categories (e.g. same risk ratio in &lt; 40 yrs and ≥ 40 yrs)\nAn effect modifier will show different magnitudes of association across its categories (e.g. the risk ratio will differ in those &lt; 40 yrs and ≥ 40 yrs).\nStratification is the simplest form of exploring and adjusting for confounding/interaction effects (used before we had all this computing power).\nSubgroups of data are created for each category of confounder/effect modifier and estimates of interest (mean differences, risk ratios, etc) calculated in each.\nThese can then be combined in a weighted manner to give an overall (adjusted) estimate if NO effect modification is present.\nThis is equivalent to including the third variable as a covariate in our regression model (we now use models rather than stratification methods).\nSimple inclusion in the regression model (using + in R) FORCES the exposure -&gt; outcome association to be the same across all categories of the effect modifier even if in reality it’s not.\n+ assumes confounding ONLY and NO effect modification.\nA problem arises, however, when the third variable is more an effect modifier, rather than confounder.\nIf we suspect effect modification is present, we need to include this third variable in the model as an interaction term (using * in R)\nThis will allow the exposure -&gt; outcome association to differ across categories of the effect modifier.\n* assumes effect modification is present.\nThis is a more flexible model specification, than simply ‘adjusting’ for a variable.\nInterpretation is a little more involved (always happy to help with this) but the point is it’s important not to blindly assume a third variable can only ever be a confounder.\nIf effect modification is present, you need to know about it.\nIt is simple to test for effect modification in R, Stata, etc. Include the interaction term and then drop it if not clinically/statistically significant at some level.\nI have included some R output below showing the equivalence of stratification and modelling approaches to interaction effects.\n\nBefore we get to that - a simple set of guidelines for how to think about crude vs stratified associations:\n\nEquivalence of model-derived crude estimate\nRecall that the aggregated data that the crude estimate is calculated from is:\n\n\nCode\ndat_agg &lt;- data.frame(sex = c(\"Male\", \"Female\"),\n                      hospitalised = as.numeric(c(1330, 798)), \n                      not_hospitalised = as.numeric(c(7018,6400)))\ndat_agg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsex\nhospitalised\nnot_hospitalised\n\n\n\n\nMale\n1330\n7018\n\n\nFemale\n798\n6400\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo estimate this model in R we essentially run a logistic regression but instead of outputting an odds ratio, we calculate a risk ratio by specifying a log rather than the default logit link. We will also use the aggregate model specification, as we don’t have the individual-level data.\nThe model-derived crude risk ratio for sex = 1.44 (95% CI 1.32, 1.56; p &lt; 0.001). This is very close to the estimate that we initially calculated manually from the 2 x 2 table (1.45).\n\n\nCode\nmod_crude &lt;- glm(cbind(hospitalised, not_hospitalised) ~ sex, data = dat_agg, family = binomial(link = \"log\"))\ntbl_regression(mod_crude, exp = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      RR1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    sex\n\n\n\n        Female\n—\n—\n\n        Male\n1.44\n1.32, 1.56\n&lt;0.001\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 RR = Relative Risk, CI = Confidence Interval"

The model formulation in R is then:\nmod_adj &lt;- glm(cbind(hospitalised, not_hospitalised) ~ sex + age, data = dat_agg, family = binomial(link = \"log\"))\nand the risk ratios we get are:\n\n\nCode\nmod_confound &lt;- glm(cbind(hospitalised, not_hospitalised) ~ sex + age, data = dat_disagg, family = binomial(link = \"log\"))\ntbl_regression(mod_confound, exp = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      RR1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    sex\n\n\n\n        Female\n—\n—\n\n        Male\n1.43\n1.32, 1.55\n&lt;0.001\n    age\n\n\n\n        &lt; 40\n—\n—\n\n        ≥ 40\n0.47\n0.43, 0.51\n&lt;0.001\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 RR = Relative Risk, CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nSo, what we are seeing here is that the magnitude of association between sex and hospitalisation risk is averaged (in a weighted way) over both categories of age to produce one effect estimate sex = 1.43 (95% CI 1.32, 1.55; p &lt; 0.001). This just so happens to be almost the same as the crude estimate when you ignore age altogether.\nThe effect for age in this model is such that whatever your sex, there is about a 53% reduction in the risk of hospitalisation if you are over 40 vs under 40. Note that in the stratification approach, you aren’t able to calculate an effect for age because you are stratifying by it (essentially treating it as a nuisance variable).\n\n\n3.2 Age as an effect modifier\nNow, let’s correctly model age as an effect modifier in the association between sex and hospitalisation risk. The model formulation in R is then (note the * operator):\nmod_adj &lt;- glm(cbind(hospitalised, not_hospitalised) ~ sex * age, data = dat_agg, family = binomial(link = \"log\"))\nand the risk ratios we get are:\n\n\nCode\nmod_interact &lt;- glm(cbind(hospitalised, not_hospitalised) ~ sex * age, data = dat_disagg, family = binomial(link = \"log\"))\ntbl_regression(mod_interact, exp = T)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      RR1\n      95% CI1\n      p-value\n    \n  \n  \n    sex\n\n\n\n        Female\n—\n—\n\n        Male\n1.77\n1.60, 1.96\n&lt;0.001\n    age\n\n\n\n        &lt; 40\n—\n—\n\n        ≥ 40\n0.70\n0.61, 0.80\n&lt;0.001\n    sex * age\n\n\n\n        Male * ≥ 40\n0.52\n0.44, 0.62\n&lt;0.001\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 RR = Relative Risk, CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nNote how the p value for the interaction term is very low - this would be a good indicator that the model fits the data better with the interaction term present than without it (i.e. assuming age as a confounder only).\nAs I mentioned earlier, the model interpretation with an interaction present does become a little more complicated, but let’s break this down (note that I use “effect” in a non-causal way):\n\nThe coefficient for sex = 1.77 (95% CI 1.60, 1.96; p &lt; 0.001). The represents the “effect” of sex (being male relative to female) on hospitalisation risk at the reference level of age, which in this case is the under 40 yrs group. So, for those under 40, there is about a 77% increased risk for males relative to females.\nThe coefficient for age = 0.70 (95% CI 0.61, 0.80; p &lt; 0.001). This represents the “effect” of age (being older than 40 yrs relative to younger than 40 yrs) on hospitalisation risk at the reference level of sex, which in this case is female. So, for females, there is about a 30% risk reduction in the need for hospitalisation for older relative to younger drivers.\nThe coefficient for the interaction term: sex * age = 0.52 (95% CI 0.44, 0.62; p &lt; 0.001). This represents the multiplicative increase in the magnitude of association for males over 40 yrs."

    "text": "4 Effect modification means more associations to estimate\nIn this specific case, when you treat age as a confounder, the model produces two risk ratios - one for sex and one for age. However, when you treat age as an effect modifier, there are now four possible risk ratios to estimate (if you care about age more than it being a “nuisance” variable to control for). These are:\n\nThe effect of being male in younger individuals.\nThe effect of being male in older individuals.\nThe effect of being older in females.\nThe effect of being older in males.\n\nYou can easily enough work these out manually by multiplying the respective reference coefficients with the interaction coefficient. The risk ratios for each of the above would then be:\n\n1.77 (we can just read this one straight off the model output)\n1.77 x 0.52 = 0.92\n0.70 (again we can just read this one straight off)\n0.70 x 0.52 = 0.36\n\nNote that the effects for 1. and 2. are very similar to what we calculated straight from the 2 x 2 tables (1.84 and 0.92, respectively - as previously mentioned, the effects for 3. and 4. aren’t able to be calculated for the stratifying variable)."

    "text": "The Answer\nThe answer is that you should switch doors, and in fact if you do switch, you double your chances of winning the car - from 33.3% to 66.7%.\nThis is known as the Monty Hall problem and when it was first posed in a magazine column in 1975 managed to confuse readers to the extent that even mathematicians were writing in to the magazine to claim that answer was in fact wrong and staying with the originally chosen door was the better strategy for success.\nThe simplest way that I can explain this is that you start out with a 33.3% chance of winning the car and those probabilities don’t change once you lock in your selection and Monty offers you another chance to choose (i.e. the probabilities don’t change to 50/50 once Monty reveals what’s behind one of the doors).\n\nIf you stay\nIf you choose the correct door to start with (for which there is a 33.3% chance), staying will result in you ending up with the car (winning).\nIf you choose the incorrect door to start with (for which there is a 66.7% chance), staying will necessarily result in you ending up with a goat (losing).\n\n\nIf you switch\nIf you choose the correct door to start with (for which there is a 33.3% chance), switching will result in you ending up with a goat (losing).\nIf you choose the incorrect door to start with (for which there is a 66.7% chance), switching will necessarily result in you ending up with the car, because Monty has to pick the only other losing door to open (winning).\nStaying is associated with a 33.3% success rate, whereas switching doubles your chance of success to 66.7%.\nStop here if equations give you the equivalent of the aftermath of eating Mexican food. What I have done below is show how we can arrive at the same answer using an analytical approach when our logic/intuition fails. You may not want to venture that far…\nWhat I think is cool about this problem is that while the result might seem counterintuitive to how we naturally process chance, using Bayesian reasoning provides a formulaic way to get at the right answer. This again uses conditional probabilities as I introduced them a few weeks ago. Bayesian thinking is about utilising prior knowledge in conjunction with new data to improve or update our knowledge (whereas the Frequentist approach to statistics doesn’t care so much about prior knowledge and instead just uses the data at hand).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Concept\n\n\n\nBayesian reasoning enables the analysis of data under the light of prior knowledge.\n\n\nBayes Theorem can be written as:\n\\[\nPr(\\theta | data) = \\frac{Pr(data | \\theta) Pr(\\theta)}{Pr(data)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta\\) could be a particular parameter or hypothesis.\nHere:\n\\(Pr(data | \\theta)\\) is the likelihood function (the data, or what we measure)\n\\(Pr(\\theta)\\) is the prior probability of our hypothesis (prior knowledge before we the measurement)\n\\(Pr(data)\\) is the prior probability of the data\n\\(Pr(\\theta | data)\\) is the posterior probability of our hypothesis (i.e. “in light of the data”)\nOn the Bayesian/Frequentist topic, note that \\(Pr(data | \\theta)\\) is what null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) encapsulates and this is a Frequentist concept. Whenever we calculate a p value we are asking:\n\n“What is the probability of this new data (or data even more extreme) occurring by chance given the null hypothesis is true?”\n\nBut really, what we want to know most of the time is the opposite:\n\n“What is the probability of the null hypothesis being true given this new data?”\n\nThat is a Bayesian concept and is answered with \\(Pr(\\theta | data)\\). Maybe we should become more Bayesian in how we handle our research…\nAnyway, excuse the digression. We can generalise Bayes Theorem to the Monty Hall problem as:\n\\[\nPr(\\text{car behind door x} | \\text{Monty opens door y}) = \\frac{Pr(\\text{Monty opens door y} | \\text{car behind door x}) Pr(\\text{car behind door x})}{Pr(\\text{Monty opens door y})}\n\\]\nFor the sake of the exercise, let x = door 1 and y = door 3.\nSo we are interested in the probability the car is behind door 1 (that means we picked door 1) when Monty opens door 3 to reveal a goat.\nIn calculating the different components of Bayes Theorem, we first need to enumerate the various probabilities.\n\\(Pr(\\text{car behind door 1}) = Pr(\\text{car behind door 2}) = Pr(\\text{car behind door 3}) = 33.3\\%\\)\nThese are the prior probabilities.\nThen:\n\\(Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3} | \\text{car behind door 1}) = 50\\%\\)\nMonty can only pick doors 2 or 3, as we picked door 1.\n\\(Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3} | \\text{car behind door 2}) = 100\\%\\)\nMonty can only pick door 3, as we picked door 1 and he doesn’t want to reveal the car behind door 2.\n\\(Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3} | \\text{car behind door 3}) = 0\\%\\)\nMonty won’t reveal the car as part of his playing rules.\nThese are the likelihoods or the data.\nThe \\(Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3})\\) is a little trickier to calculate. Here we don’t need to worry about the car being behind any specific door, only that Monty won’t reveal it. Intuitively, this would be \\(50\\%\\) as he only has two doors to choose from. But you can also work this out by summing the product of each of the prior probabilities and the evidence:\n\\(Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3}) = (0.33 * 0.5) + (0.33 * 1) + (0.33 * 0) = 0.5\\)\nFinally, we can get to working out the posterior probabilities of the car being behind each door given Monty opens door 3. We use Bayes Theorem as shown above to do this.\n\\[\nPr(\\text{car behind door 1} | \\text{Monty opens door 3}) = \\frac{Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3} | \\text{car behind door 1}) Pr(\\text{car behind door 1})}{Pr(\\text{Monty opens door 3})}\n\\] \\[\n= \\frac{0.5 * 0.33}{0.5} = 33.3\\%\n\\] Likewise:\n\\[\nPr(\\text{car behind door 2} | \\text{Monty opens door 3})  = \\frac{1 * 0.33}{0.5} = 66.7\\%\n\\] and\n\\[\nPr(\\text{car behind door 3} | \\text{Monty opens door 3})  = \\frac{0 * 0.33}{0.5} = 0\\%\n\\]\nRemember, we initially chose door 1. So, when Monty opens door 3 (this could have been door 2 - we just needed to pick a door for the exercise), we double our chances of winning by switching to door 2. And this is how Bayesian reasoning can come to the rescue when our own intuition fails.\nFurther explanation can be found here if you remain unconvinced:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem\nhttps://statisticsbyjim.com/fun/monty-hall-problem/"

    "text": "In 2001, a paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine reported that Oscar winners had a longer life expectancy - by about 4 years - compared to their less successful peers. The authors conclusions were that:\n“The association of high status with increased longevity that prevails in the public also extends to celebrities, contributes to a large survival advantage, and is partially explained by factors related to success.”\nThe study received widespread attention in the media, with one future Oscar winner acknowledging the work in her acceptance speech.\nThe problem was that the reported survival advantage was illusory, and the reason for this was an invalid analysis that is not alone in the literature. As in any simple time-to-event analysis, two groups may be compared in their respective ‘survival’ times. In this study, subjects were first classified as winners or non-winners and observation time counted as their time alive. The error in this case was to consider winning status time-fixed (A), when in reality it is time-varying (B). By naively assuming it is time-fixed, we are erroneously attributing the time that a winner was in fact a loser prior to getting their gong, to their winning observation time.\n\nThis creates a distortion or bias in the exposure/treatment -&gt; outcome association, usually in a direction that overestimates the benefit of the exposure/treatment. When proper methods are then employed, the perceived benefits are reduced or sometimes reversed. And in fact that is exactly what was found when a re-analysis of the data was conducted in 2006 - the survival advantage was calculated to be closer to 1 year and not deemed statistically significant.\nIn general, the observation time prior to the exposure/treatment commencing (for those exposed/treated) is considered ‘immortal’, because the subject cannot experience the outcome during this period as they have yet to receive the exposure/treatment. If you are like me, this fairly classic description of immortal time hurts my brain and so I just like to simply think of it as the period that a person’s observation time has been misclassified.\nObservational research that involves time-to-event outcomes is particularly prone to immortal time bias and central to the problem is the specification of ‘time zero’ - i.e. when does the clock start? There are several examples of study design choices that can lead you down the wrong analysis path if you are not careful, and an especially pertinent one in this field is drawing contrasts between treated and untreated patients (hint: a patient is not ‘treated’ for the duration of their observation time if they were only on treatment for the last 10% of that time).\nSo, what’s the solution?\nTime-varying covariates\nI will illustrate their use in an example next week."

    "text": "Last week I introduced the concept of immortal time bias and how it can distort associations in your survival analysis, if you naively misclassify unexposed/untreated observation time as exposed/treated. This week I am going to illustrate the concept with some data and R code. It would have been good to analyse the Oscar Winner’s data but as I could not locate that, instead we are going to look at one of the first studies in which immortal time bias was subsequently recognised to be a problem.\nhe design or analysis will lead to immortal time bias. The first recorded instance of bias from immortal time in epidemiology was in the early 1970s in the context of two cohort studies from Texas and Stanford University (Palo Alto, California) of the benefit of heart transplantation (15, 16). In the Texas Heart Institute study, the survival time of 15 patients who received a heart transplant (mean 111 days, including the waiting time from acceptance for a trans- plant until transplantation) was found to be longer than the survival of 42 potential recipients who were accepted for a transplant but did not receive one (mean 74 days) (15). In the Stanford Heart Transplant study, the survival of 20 pa- tients who received a heart transplant (mean 200 days after transplantation) was found to be longer than the survival of 14 potential recipients who did not receive a transplant (mean 34 days) (16). Gail (17) identified a source of bias in these two studies stemming from a relevant portion of follow-up time— namely, the waiting time of all patients who survived to make it to the transplant—that was not properly accounted for in the data analysis. Indeed, because this portion of the follow-up time was classified as exposed to transplantation instead of unexposed, it offered a guaranteed survival time to the transplanted group. As a result, by not being correctly classified, this immortal time produced an artificial increase in the mortality rate of the reference group, thus suggesting a benefit of heart transplant surgery. In a reanalysis of the Stanford Heart Transplant data, Mantel and Byar (18) found that the apparent major survival advantage of the trans- planted group disappears when the immortal time is prop- erly accounted for by a time-dependent analysis (hazard ratio (HR) 1⁄4 0.93, p 1⁄4 0.9).\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(survival)\nlibrary(survminer)\ndata(heart, package = \"survival\")\nhead(jasa)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbirth.dt\naccept.dt\ntx.date\nfu.date\nfustat\nsurgery\nage\nfutime\nwait.time\ntransplant\nmismatch\nhla.a2\nmscore\nreject\n\n\n\n\n1937-01-10\n1967-11-15\nNA\n1968-01-03\n1\n0\n30.84463\n49\nNA\n0\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n1916-03-02\n1968-01-02\nNA\n1968-01-07\n1\n0\n51.83573\n5\nNA\n0\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n1913-09-19\n1968-01-06\n1968-01-06\n1968-01-21\n1\n0\n54.29706\n15\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1.11\n0\n\n\n1927-12-23\n1968-03-28\n1968-05-02\n1968-05-05\n1\n0\n40.26283\n38\n35\n1\n3\n0\n1.66\n0\n\n\n1947-07-28\n1968-05-10\nNA\n1968-05-27\n1\n0\n20.78576\n17\nNA\n0\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n1913-11-08\n1968-06-13\nNA\n1968-06-15\n1\n0\n54.59548\n2\nNA\n0\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Visualise survival trajectories of random sample of women\n\njasa$id &lt;- seq(1:dim(jasa)[1])\ntemp &lt;- jasa\ntemp$wait.time[is.na(temp$wait.time)] &lt;- temp$futime[is.na(temp$wait.time)]\n\ntemp |&gt; # Use this to sort 2 groups in plot\n  ggplot(aes(x = id, y = futime)) +\n  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = wait.time), color = \"#E7B800\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = wait.time, ymax = futime), color = \"#2E9FDF\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(aes(shape = factor(fustat)), stroke = 1, cex = 1, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1, 3), labels = c(\"Censored\", \"Died\"), name = \"Outcome\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 95, y = 1400, label = \"Observation time = yellow - untransplanted\", size = 5, color = \"#E7B800\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 92, y = 1380, label = \"Observation time = blue - post-transplant\", size = 5, color = \"#2E9FDF\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Survival Trajectories for Heart Transplant Patients\") +   \n  ylab(\"Time (days)\") +\n  xlab(\"Patient Number\") + \n  coord_flip() + \n  theme_bw(base_size = 15) +\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfit &lt;- survfit(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ transplant, data = jasa)\nggsurvplot(fit,\n          pval = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE,\n          risk.table = TRUE, # Add risk table\n          risk.table.col = \"strata\", # Change risk table color by groups\n          linetype = \"strata\", # Change line type by groups\n          surv.median.line = \"hv\", # Specify median survival\n          ggtheme = theme_bw(), # Change ggplot2 theme\n          palette = c(\"#E7B800\", \"#2E9FDF\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmod &lt;- coxph(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ transplant, data = jasa)\nsummary(mod)\n\n\nCall:\ncoxph(formula = Surv(futime, fustat) ~ transplant, data = jasa)\n\n  n= 103, number of events= 75 \n\n              coef exp(coef) se(coef)      z Pr(&gt;|z|)    \ntransplant -1.3234    0.2662   0.2438 -5.428 5.69e-08 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n           exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95\ntransplant    0.2662      3.756    0.1651    0.4293\n\nConcordance= 0.668  (se = 0.025 )\nLikelihood ratio test= 25.95  on 1 df,   p=4e-07\nWald test            = 29.47  on 1 df,   p=6e-08\nScore (logrank) test = 33.38  on 1 df,   p=8e-09"
