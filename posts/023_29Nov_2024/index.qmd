**For the last post of this year,**

**Here's some Xmas-themed researcher cheer,**

**Each 'day' is a statistical pearl,**

**For your next manuscript give them a whirl,**

**Take heed of the 12 recommendations made,**

**And you will make my life a lot easier.**

Hmm, I just realised that last line might not completely rhyme - I'll work on something better, but in the meantime please accept that as a placeholder...

In your downtime over the upcoming break I can thoroughly recommend a read of the following 2022 BMJ Christmas edition paper:

[On the 12th Day of Christmas, a Statistician Sent to Me . . .](https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj-2022-072883)

Being not only aware of, but proactive about these common statistical faux pas will, I believe, help you in your chances of future successful submissions - as well as becoming better clinical researchers.

The slides I used in recent lab meetings relating to this talk are included below.

Merry Xmas and Happy New Year to all! See you in 2025.

(BTW - the home page image was created in ChatGPT with the prompt "Create a christmas-themed image of a statistician wearing a santa hat". I guess you get what you ask for...)
