Last week I introduced the concept of immortal time bias and how it can distort associations in your survival analysis, if you naively misclassify unexposed/untreated observation time as exposed/treated. This week I am going to illustrate the concept with some data and `R` code. It would have been good to analyse the Oscar Winner's data but as I could not locate that anywhere online, we are instead going to look at [one of the first studies](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2286902 "https://www.jstor.org/stable/2286902"){style="color: #1f7de6"} in which immortal time bias was subsequently recognised to be a problem.

The work came out of Stanford University in the early 1970s and assessed the survival benefit of potential heart transplant recipients. In the analysis, the event of interest was death and the primary treatment was heart transplantation - so survival amongst transplant recipients was compared to that amongst accepted patients into the program that did not end up receiving a transplant. Treatment was initially considered **time-fixed** and the patients divided into two groups - '*ever transplanted*' vs '*never transplanted*'. Survival time amongst recipients was found to be longer than those who didn't receive transplantation.

The immortal time bias here involves the waiting time of those patients who survived to make it to the transplant. Because this portion of the observation time was classified as exposed to transplantation instead of unexposed, it offered a guaranteed survival time to the transplanted group. The result of this misclassification was to produce an artificial increase in the mortality rate of the reference group, thus suggesting a benefit of heart transplant surgery. In a later reanalysis of the data, the apparent survival benefit of the transplanted group disappeared when the immortal time was properly accounted for by a time-dependent analysis.

## Load data

As this study is considered a canonical example of immortal time bias, the data comes built into `R`'s `survival` package. We can load the data and inspect the relevant `jasa` dataframe as below.

```{r}
#| label: load data
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(survival)
library(survminer)
library(gtsummary)
library(dplyr)
data(heart, package = "survival")
head(jasa)
```

The variables that we're going to use are:

-   `fustat` - the 'event' variable; 0 = alive, 1 = dead at the end of follow-up.

-   `futime` - the primary 'time' variable; time (days) from acceptance into the transplant program until death or censoring.

-   `wait.time` - the secondary 'time' variable; time (days) from acceptance into the transplant program until receiving a heart if transplanted (`NA` for those who never underwent transplant surgery).

-   `transplant` - the 'treatment/exposure' variable; 0 = did not receive heart, 1 = received heart.

## Visualise individual survival trajectories

Using a bit of `ggplot2` magic, we can now plot the individual observation times for the 103 patients in the study. Note that I have stratified observation time by transplant status (<FONT COLOR = "#E7B800">orange</FONT> for the period a patient remains untransplanted and <FONT COLOR = "#2E9FDF">blue</FONT> for the period following a transplant).

```{r}
#| label: survival trajectories
# Create 'id' variable
jasa$id <- seq(1:dim(jasa)[1])
# Replace wait.time with futime if didn't undergo transplant
jasa$wait.time[is.na(jasa$wait.time)] <- jasa$futime[is.na(jasa$wait.time)]
# Plot
jasa |>
  ggplot(aes(x = id, y = futime)) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = wait.time), color = "#E7B800", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_linerange(aes(ymin = wait.time, ymax = futime), color = "#2E9FDF", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = factor(fustat)), stroke = 1, cex = 1, color = "black") +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(1, 3), labels = c("Censored", "Died"), name = "Outcome") +
  annotate("text", x = 95, y = 1400, label = "Observation time = yellow - untransplanted", size = 5, color = "#E7B800") +
  annotate("text", x = 92, y = 1380, label = "Observation time = blue - post-transplant", size = 5, color = "#2E9FDF") +
  ggtitle("Survival Trajectories for Heart Transplant Patients") +   
  ylab("Time (days)") +
  xlab("Patient Number") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15))
```

## Naive analysis assuming treatment status is time-fixed

### Visualise survival curves

Plotting the **Kaplan-Meier** survival curves are easy by first saving the `survfit` object:

`fit <- survfit(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ transplant, data = jasa)`

and then passing this `ggsurvplot` which does a nicer job of plotting survival data then using `R`'s `base` functions. Note that we ignore `wait.time` and only specify `futime` in our fit function. This is because we are assuming if a patient was transplanted, the entire duration of their observation period was considered as such.

```{r}
#| label: naive KM curve
fit_naive <- survfit(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ transplant, data = jasa)
ggsurvplot(fit_naive,
          risk.table = TRUE,
          risk.table.col = "strata",
          linetype = "strata",
          surv.median.line = "hv",
          ggtheme = theme_bw(base_size = 20),
          palette = c("#E7B800", "#2E9FDF"))
```

### Cox model

Fitting a Cox model is also simple with:

`mod_naive <- coxph(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ transplant, data = jasa)`

```{r}
#| label: naive Cox
mod_naive <- coxph(Surv(futime, fustat) ~ transplant, data = jasa)
tbl_regression(mod_naive, exp = T)
```

This gives a `HR = 0.27 (95% CI 0.17, 0.43; p < 0.001)` indicating that there is about a 73% reduction in the risk of death with transplantation. Pretty effective, right?

## Correct analysis assuming treatment status is time-varying

Up until now we have just used the data as it's been presented to us. Each patient has a single observation with all information about them contained in that row of data. However, to perform the correct time-dependent analysis we first need to construct a time-varying version of the treatment (i.e. transplant) variable. This data format is known as **'counting process'** and in the general case involves creating potentially multiple rows of data for each patient with each row corresponding to a different exposure/treatment period of that patients observation time. In this specific example, we will create an additional row of data for transplanted patients splitting time at the point of transplant, so that the first row contains the time from acceptance into the transplant program to the point of transplant, and the second row contains the time from transplant to either death or censoring. We specify this in **'start, stop'** format rather than the duration of the interval itself. We use the `tmerge` [function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/survival/versions/3.5-7/topics/tmerge){style="color: #1f7de6"} to do this.

```{r}
#| label: tmerge
# Create subset of data selecting relevant variables
jasa_subset <- jasa |> 
  select(id, transplant, wait.time, futime, fustat)

jasa_subset$futime[jasa_subset$futime == 0] <- 0.5

jasa_cp <- tmerge(data1 = jasa_subset |> select(id, futime, fustat), 
                  data2 = jasa_subset |> select(id, futime, fustat, wait.time, transplant), 
                  id = id, 
                  death = event(futime, fustat),
                  transplant = tdc(wait.time)) |> 
            select(-c(futime, fustat))

```

### Visualise survival curves

```{r}
#| label: correct KM curve
fit_correct <- survfit(Surv(start, stop, event) ~ transplant, data = jasa1)
ggsurvplot(fit_correct,
          risk.table = TRUE,
          risk.table.col = "strata",
          linetype = "strata",
          surv.median.line = "hv",
          ggtheme = theme_bw(base_size = 20),
          palette = c("#E7B800", "#2E9FDF"))
```

### Cox model

```{r}
#| label: correct Cox
mod_correct <- coxph(Surv(start, stop, event) ~ transplant, data = jasa1)
tbl_regression(mod_correct, exp = T)

mod_correct2 <- coxph(Surv(tstart, tstop, death) ~ transplant, data = jasa_cp)
tbl_regression(mod_correct2, exp = T)
```
