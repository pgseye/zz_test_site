The examples that I've used so far in this series of posts on model prediction and visualisation have all involved a continuous outcome measure (birthweight measured in grams), and so accordingly we have used a simple linear (regression) model. Nothing difficult there. But does anything change in the visualisation process when the models become a little more advanced?

Well, the answer is both yes and no (sorry!). While the coding fundamentals largely remain the same, there are some additional considerations in the visualisation of GLM's (as well as mixed and survival models which we will discuss in future posts) that you need to be aware of and better still, understand.

So let's get to it. We'll again use the familiar `birthwt` dataset, this time to predict from, and visualise a logistic regression model. Our outcome variable (`low`) is now a dichotomised version of birthweight, with `1` assigned to values less than `2500` grams and `0` to values that are greater. In the first instance we'll assume a linear relationship of maternal age with the log-odds of low birthweight and our model may be written as:

`mod <-  glm(low ~ age, family = "binomial", data = birthwt)`

If you recall in the last post, we excluded the observation for the oldest mother having the heaviest baby, and we will do that again here.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(splines)
library(gtsummary)
data(birthwt, package = "MASS")
# Model
mod <-  glm(low ~ age, family = "binomial", data = subset(birthwt, age < 40))
tbl_regression(mod, intercept = T)
```

The model suggests that there is an \~ `0.05` reduction in the log-odds of being low birthweight with each year increase in maternal age.
