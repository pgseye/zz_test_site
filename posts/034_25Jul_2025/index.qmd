Welcome back after a brief mid-year break.

In the last post we discussed some approaches to the diagnosis of non-proportional hazards for a covariate in our Cox model. Today we are going to consider several remediation actions we can take when we are faced with this issue in our day-to-day work. To get us started I've broken those actions down broadly into four groups:

1.  Model specification adjustments.

2.  Use strata (categorical variables only).

3.  Incorporate non-proportionality into the model (time-dependent coefficients).

    -   Step functions (different HR's over different time intervals).

    -   Continuous time-dependent coefficients (smoothed HR over time).

4.  Use a different type of model.

    -   Accelerated failure time model.

    -   Flexible parametric (Royston-Parmar) survival model.
