Notes:

- Make note about working in log scale and exponentiating the axis lables (as per EdM's remarks)



Part 2

- Talk about non-survival analysis steps to fix non-proportional hazards:
The power of the test to detect nonproportionality is dependent on the correct specification of the model. Specifically, omitted covariates and interactions as well as nonlinear functional forms can appear as violations of the proportional hazards assumption complicating the detection of nonproportionality.

Then talk about:
-Use strata (categorical variables onl y)
-Incorporate non-proportionality in model
-Use another type of model
 accelerated failure time model
 RP model


- Can you use an AFT Weibull model if proportional hazards don't hold? Apparently not:
