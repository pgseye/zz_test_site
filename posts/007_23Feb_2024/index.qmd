It is easy enough to view a dataframe in `RStudio` by opening the dataframe in the viewer or printing the dataframe (or part of it) to the console. However, this can be messy if you want to quickly identify data by a grouping variable (usually the patient id). The `by()` function can help you to do this. Let's illustrate its utility with the `sleepstudy` dataset from the `lme4` package. To start with I'll print the data for the first 3 subjects as one might.

`sleepstudy |> as_tibble() |> print(n = 30)`

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
library(lme4)
library(dplyr)
# Load data
data("sleepstudy")
sleepstudy |> as_tibble() |> print(n = 30)
```

But we can do this better with:

`by(sleepstudy, sleepstudy$PATIENT_ID, identity)[1:3]`

Note that the `[1:3]` indicates the range of group indices that you want to view.

```{r}
#| label: by()
by(sleepstudy, sleepstudy$Subject, identity)[1:3]
```

If you want to take this a step further, you can generalise this with a function that will allow you to quickly view the data in any range that you want, without having to continually copy and paste that line of code. You will need to do a little bit of housekeeping with dataframe and group variable names for the function to work but it's not much extra effort.

`df <- sleepstudy      # substitute your df name here`\
`df$ids <- df$Subject  # substitute your df and id variable names here`\
`print_groups(df, 1, 3)`

```{r}
#| label: function
# Create function
print_groups <- function(df, index1, index2) {
  ids_all <-  unique(df$ids)
  ids_range <- ids_all[index1:index2]
  if (index1 <= length(ids_all) & index2 <= length(ids_all)) {
    for (id in ids_range) {
      temp <- df[df$ids %in% id,]
      print(by(temp, temp$ids, identity)[id])
      cat("----------------------------\n\n")
    }
  } else {
    print("There aren't that many groups in your dataset")
  }
}

# Get your data ready to use with function
df <- sleepstudy              # substitute your df name here
df$ids <- sleepstudy$Subject  # substitute your df and id variable names here
# Use function
print_groups(df, 1, 3)
```

And there you have it!
