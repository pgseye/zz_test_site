The authors conclusions were that:\n\n**\"The association of high status with increased longevity that prevails in the public also extends to celebrities, contributes to a large survival advantage, and is partially explained by factors related to success.\"**\n\nThe study received widespread attention in the media, with one future Oscar winner acknowledging the work in her acceptance [speech](https://www.thecut.com/2015/02/oscar-winners-really-live-longer.html \"https://www.thecut.com/2015/02/oscar-winners-really-live-longer.html\"){style=\"color: #1a0dab\"}.\n\nThe problem was that the reported survival advantage was illusory, and the reason for this was an invalid analysis that has been repeated many times in the [literature](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17252614/ \"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17252614/\"){style=\"color: #1a0dab\"}.\n\nWinners given credit for survival as winners before they won. Winning can't possibly have contributed to this portion of their survival.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat <- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgseye/data/main/heart.csv\", header = T)\n\n#data(heart, package=\"survival\")\nhead(dat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n| start| stop| event|        age|      year| surgery| transplant| id|\n|-----:|----:|-----:|----------:|---------:|-------:|----------:|--:|\n|     0|   50|     1| -17.155373| 0.1232033|       0|          0|  1|\n|     0|    6|     1|   3.835729| 0.2546201|       0|          0|  2|\n|     0|    1|     0|   6.297057| 0.2655715|       0|          0|  3|\n|     1|   16|     1|   6.297057| 0.2655715|       0|          1|  3|\n|     0|   36|     0|  -7.737166| 0.4900753|       0|          0|  4|\n|    36|   39|     1|  -7.737166| 0.4900753|       0|          1|  4|\n\n</div>\n:::\n:::\n",
